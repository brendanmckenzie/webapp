# Web App

What is this?

A boilerplate for the [best way to build a website](http://www.brendanmckenzie.com/blog/2014/07/musings-about-web-application-development) *lol*

Ideally the only thing deployed to the production server is the compiled version of the `webapp` binary.

Everything in `public` should be deployed to whatever `CDN_ROOT` is set to.

`dev-cdn.js` can be used as a CDN host during development.
